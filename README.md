# BienFusionPBX
FusionPBX Postgresql install with Dutch preferences

This project runs the original FusionPBX installation script from Marc Crane (https://github.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx) 
Afterwards we change some settings that will make Freeswitch run with Postgresql, change the default ring tone from 
us-ring to fr-ring (More Europe style ;) )

We use the Contacts in FusionPBX as our default telephone book.
Yealink xml file updates to load Dutch GUI after the firmware upgrade.

Besides the fusionpbx app directory will be extended with de bien dialer en panel interface.
The Bien Dialer is an interface running on Mac & Windows to initiate phone calls from your computer 
to you extension.
